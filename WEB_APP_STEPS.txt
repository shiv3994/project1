
1.)  Created a folder within my workspace on Cloud9, named it <cgi-bin>
2.)  Within the <cgi-bin> folder, uploaded the file <new.py>
3.)  Once I uploaded the file I wanted to serve, I started up the Apache web server-by creating a new runner 
     and the selected- Apache httpd (PHP, HTML)
4.)  Clicked on the Run button and the apache server was ready to go.
5.)  Enabled the CGI mode by typing the following within the Terminal- sudo a2enmod cgi
6.)  Told Apache where my CGI files were present by doing the following- sudo vi /etc/apache2/conf-available/serve-cgi-bin.conf

7.) The file read something like this:

<IfModule mod_alias.c>
        <IfModule mod_cgi.c>
                Define ENABLE_USR_LIB_CGI_BIN
        </IfModule>

        <IfModule mod_cgid.c>
                Define ENABLE_USR_LIB_CGI_BIN
        </IfModule>

        <IfDefine ENABLE_USR_LIB_CGI_BIN>
                ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /usr/lib/cgi-bin/
                <Directory "/usr/lib/cgi-bin">
                        AllowOverride None
                        Options +ExecCGI -MultiViews +SymLinksIfOwnerMatch
                        Require all granted
                </Directory>
        </IfDefine>
</IfModule>

8.) Modified the following section 
                 from:

<IfDefine ENABLE_USR_LIB_CGI_BIN>
    ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /usr/lib/cgi-bin/
    <Directory "/usr/lib/cgi-bin">
        AllowOverride None
        Options +ExecCGI -MultiViews +SymLinksIfOwnerMatch
        Require all granted
    </Directory>
</IfDefine>

                   to:

<IfDefine ENABLE_USR_LIB_CGI_BIN>
    ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /home/ubuntu/workspace/cgi-bin/
    <Directory "/home/ubuntu/workspace/cgi-bin">
        AllowOverride None
        Options +ExecCGI -MultiViews +SymLinksIfOwnerMatch
        AddHandler cgi-script .cgi .py
        Require all granted
    </Directory>
</IfDefine>

9.) Saved this file and restarted the  Apache.

10.) But I got one error after this- 403 permission denied cannot acces cgi-bin folder.
     I tried changing the permissions of this folder using chmod but it didn't work.
     That is why I couldnt create the web app.
